IP Address Structure
 
IPV4 address consists of 32 bit where every 8 bits/octet are separated with . from each other.

Each Octet ranges from 0-255.

Class A

192.0.0.0/8 where first 8 bits are reserved for network.So number of host are 2^24(32-8=24)=16,777,216.

Class B

192.168.0.0/16 where first two 8 bits are reserved for network.So number of host are 2^16(32-16=16)=65536.

Class C

192.168.168.0/24 where first three 8 bits are reserved for network.So number of host are 2^8(32-24=8)=256.


Standard Private IPV4 Address Range:

10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (/8 prefix)

172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (/12 prefix)

192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (/16 prefix)


Example 192.168.0.0/16 (N/W Prefix)

Formula:

Total Available Host Bits= Total Bits - N/W Prefix

Total Available IP's = 2^Total Available Host Bits

Total Available Host Bits = 32-16 = 16

Total Available IP's = 2^16 = 65536


Lets check in detail now

192.168.0.0/16 = 32-16 = 16 = 2^16 = 65536
